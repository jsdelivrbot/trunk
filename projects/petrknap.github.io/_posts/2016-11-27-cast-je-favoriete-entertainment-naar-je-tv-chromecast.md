As Microsoft sheep (and Android hater) I never had reason to try *Google Chromecast*.
But the price, 50 USD with TAX in Czech Republic, was very interesting and when I was selecting new television I had to decide:
**To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV** with smart "box" and **which smart "box" to choose**?



## To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV?

This decision was very easy - **always buy "just" TV**.
Development of display technology is very slow, but software development is one of the fastest processes which I know.
If you buy "just" TV, it will be many years as good as now.
**If you buy "smart" TV, it will be "just" TV in two years due to lack of updates**.

I wanted to buy non-smart, DirectLED, FullHD, DVB-T2 compatible, 30" television under 400 USD with TAX - [*LG 32LH530V*] was the best.



## Fun with smart "box"

The real question was which smart "box" to choose.
I was thinking about *HTPC*, [*Raspberry pi*] and [*Google Chromecast*].

When high price eliminated *HTPC*, *Raspberry pi* was my favorite.
Before I found out that **I needed something like a wireless HDMI** and *Google Chromecast* is perfect solution for me.


### Eenvouding instellen

It was very surprising when I plugged my new *Google Chromecast* to my new *LG 32LH530V*...

It comes from the Netherlands distribution, I love our European Union's single market.
The good news is that the real setup is realized through another device in correct language and **during setup was *Google Chromecast* switched into the same language**.

And how it works? Perfectly, **as wireless HDMI it's perfect**.
It communicates over WiFi and **the output stream consumes about 6 Mb/s**.
If you are streaming from WiFi to *Google Chromecast* on the same WiFi, all data go through your router and **you need transfer twice as much data**.
The ideal solution is to use 802.11n standard which provides enough speed.

![Network history](/notes/data/2016-11-27/google-chromecast-2/network-history.png)

There are some applications which work with *Google Chromecast* natively (for example [*YouTube*] and [*Videostream*]), but the main power is hidden in casting from [*Google Chrome*] via [*Google Cast*] extension.
With this extension **you can cast a browser tab, application window or whole screen to your television**, in high resolution (delay included).



## Conclusion

*Google Chromecast* is really **useless if you are looking a media player**.
You need another device which controls it and provides the content.
Buy *HTPC* or [*Raspberry pi*] instead.

![Google Chromecast 2](/notes/data/2016-11-27/google-chromecast-2/box.jpg)

[*Google Chromecast*] is **great for these who can't directly connect theirs devices via HDMI cable**.
[*Google Cast*] works great on *Windows 10*.
On *Ubuntu 16* doesn't work audio in window and screen casting via *Google Cast*.
Applications with native support (for example [*YouTube*] and [*Videostream*]) and [*Google Chrome*] tab cast works on *Ubuntu 16* as well as on *Windows 10*.
For *Windows Phone* there is application called [*TubeCast for YouTube*] which works.
And finally, for [*VLC*] users, there is **native support in VLC 3**.
