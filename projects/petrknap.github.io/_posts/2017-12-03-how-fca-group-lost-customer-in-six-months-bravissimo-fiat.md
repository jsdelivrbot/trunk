After two years of driving my German car **it was time to say goodbye**.
I said to myself:
*Enough of these sharp lines, I want a car full of emotions, a car full of passion.*
I wanted **a car which I would be happy with**, an Italian car.

I started looking at Alfa-Romeo, FIAT and even at Maserati.
Finally **I chose the FIAT Tipo**, because the car fulfilled several features – Italian not-so-large sedan in black color.
Car for gangsters, **I started to look forward to it**.

I picked up the car last March.
It was a **very joyful day for me**, finally I had my dream Italian car.
My black sedan, friends named it "Al Tipone".
**I had no idea how many complications and problems with the car were on the way.**


## Metallic paint disappeared from the roof of the car

It all started **less than half a year after the purchase of the factory-new car**.
After my return from a business trip, something appeared on the roof of the car - something that looked like a drop of color.
I washed the car, and when the paint didn't go wash off, I touched it with my finger and found it wasn't a drop of color.
**Metallic paint disappeared from the roof of the car.**
I immediately brought the car to the dealer for a complaint and the whole thing started.

I arrived at the dealer with the words that I want to submit a complaint about the car paint.
The technician said he's **never seen anything like this**.
He invited two more workers, and they began to consult what happened with the car.
It took an hour and **they did not allow me to submit the complaint through their consultation**.

So **I contacted the customer care of FCA Group**.
I explained to them what happened, that I wanted to submit a complaint about the paint, etc.
The answer was a mere message that **customer care is sorry but does not care** about the relationship between the dealer, the service and the customer.
So I took the lead myself and tried to submit the complaint over and over and over again.

I finally successfully submitted the first complaint.
Everything was **completely conflicting**, and the complaint was rejected.
**I sent a complaint to the Česká Obchodní Inspekce**, due to suspicion of repeated violations of laws.


## Strange objects under painting & behind rear light

About a week later **I discovered a strange object under the surface of the painting** – dirt, shaving...
I still don't know what it is.
Again, I tried to complain and **again the submission of the complaint failed** for the first time.

After these two problems with painting **there was a third problem** - with the rear light.
The lights are supplied to the factory wrapped in a protective film.
**This film must be removed before the light is mounted, but not at FIAT.**
The light was installed wrapped in a protective film.
The **third complaint was in the world**.

## Current situation

The current situation is that FIAT:

 * **rejected** the first complaint
 * **decides** on the second complaint / updated: **approved** after 31 days of silence
 * **approved** the third complaint and the rear-light was fixed
 
It has been taking **several months and 1 of 3 defects has been repaired**.


## Conclusion

Thanks to the choice of FIAT **I feel like the biggest piece of crap**.
The customer is good enough for...
But enough of the feelings – the fact is that:

 * **FCA Group lost a customer** who buys new car every 1-3 years
 * **I lost my interest in Italian cars** in general 
 * **I'm waiting for factory-new Citröen** C4 Cactus now

I apologize to all fans of FCA Group and **thank you all for reading and sharing**.
