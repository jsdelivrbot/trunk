## What is service locator pattern?

> The **service locator** pattern is a design pattern used in software development **to encapsulate** the processes involved in obtaining **a service with a strong abstraction layer**. This pattern uses a central registry known as the "service locator", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.
